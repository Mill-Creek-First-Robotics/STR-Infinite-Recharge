What is the meaning of life, if not to provide for family, for how can one say that they provide, when there is no provision for death? If so, then the only true meaning can be in death itself, for death is the one constant in all life. 

### ... and that's why we need robots.

**Day 1:** We need Chris. Jason said he went into the forest to find AllignToAngle code last night and hasn't come back...

**Day 2:** We'll settle for Phillip; He's not Chris, but he's our best bet now

**Day 3:** We lost Phillip. A pack of furries showed up and took him away. god help him...

**Day 4:** Spencer is now replacement Chris. It's not ideal, but it's all we have

**Day 5:** Spencer is gone too. Jason is now the replacement. This may be the end.

**Day 6:**  Jason's gone. There's something odd happening, but I can't put my finger on it. In the meantime, Jordan is in charge.

**Day 7:**  Jordan dissapeared. I finally understand, though. Every time we appoint a leader, the furries take them away in the night. Im going to set up a trap for them. Hopefully it works...

**Day 8** Im going to take charge. I hope they take the bait.

**Night 8** They took it! we were able to take them by surprise. They retreated, but we were able to injure most of them.

**Day 9** The furries counterattacked. I underestimated their strength. Liam died, but if they're holding Chris cptive, it'll be worth it to get him back.

**Day 10** We followed a trail of fur that led us to their main camp. We can end this here.

**Day 11** I decided to free Chris first and sneak past the furries. It's a risk but it's definitely safer than a full on assault

**Day 12** I was able to find Chris! Now we can finish the code.

**Day 13** After the robot was complete the furries surrendered. Everyone came back. They don't remember anything. Weird.
